N/A - WIP

## Objective: Learning Django

### An introduction to making an application

Create an app that mimics urban dictionary in basic functionality. When run, the project should be able to accept a word and it's associated definition.

Also implement a very rudimentary search: a different form on the main page should allow you to input a search term and your app should search for words that have that term in either the word itself or it's 'definition'

## Acceptance criteria

Here's the workflow that should work as an acceptance criteria:

1. start server and navigate to the locally hosted site
2. Input "joey" as a new word
3. Input "a baby kangaroo" as the definition for that word
4. click submit button for the new word form
5. navigate to the word list page, observe that the word "joey" has been added to the list of defined words
6. input "kangaroo" in the search bar and hit submit for the search bar form
7. Be taken to a page of results wherein "joey" is in the list of found words
